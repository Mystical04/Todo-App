📝 React Todo Application (with Convex Database)

This project is a Todo Application built using React and Convex as the backend database.
It serves as my first hands-on experience developing a full-stack application with React and integrating it with a real-time database using Convex.

🚀 About the Project

The React Todo App allows users to:

✅ Add new tasks <br>
✅ Edit existing tasks <br>
✅ Delete completed or unwanted tasks <br>
✅ Store and retrieve todos in real-time using Convex

This project was developed primarily for learning purposes, focusing on understanding:

✅ React fundamentals (components, hooks, and state management) <br>
✅ Database integration with Convex <br>
✅ Real-time data synchronization <br>

🧩 Tech Stack

Frontend: React (with Vite or Create React App)

Backend / Database: Convex

Language: TypeScript / JavaScript

📦 Features

✅ Add and manage your daily tasks easily <br>
✅ Automatically sync data in real-time <br>
✅ Simple and clean UI design <br>
✅ Lightweight and fast setup <br>

💡 Learning Goals

This project helped me:

✅ Understand how to use React for building modern user interfaces <br>
✅ Learn how Convex handles backend logic and data persistence <br>
✅ Explore the flow between frontend components and backend functions <br>
